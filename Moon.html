    <h1>The Moon</h1>

    <p>
The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, a rocky body with a diameter about a quarter of Earth's size, orbiting at an average distance of 384,400 km. It lacks an atmosphere, which prevents life from existing and contributes to extreme temperature variations. The Moon's synchronous rotation means the same side always faces Earth, leading to visible phases as it orbits, completing a full orbit in about 29.5 days.  
<p> <strong>Characteristics</strong> </p>
<strong>Natural Satellite:</strong>
<ul>Earth's only natural companion, providing the Moon with its name. </ul>
<strong>Size:</strong>
<ul>Approximately 3,475 km in diameter, making it roughly a quarter the size of Earth. </ul>
<strong>Orbit:</strong>
<ul>It orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) and takes about 29.5 days to complete a single orbit. </ul>
<strong>Surface:</strong>
<ul>A dusty, cratered surface formed by impacts from meteoroids, asteroids, and comets. </ul>
<strong>Gravity:</strong>
<ul>The Moon's gravity is only one-sixth that of Earth, meaning a person would weigh significantly less there. </ul>
<h3>Orbit and Phases</h3>
<strong>Synchronous Rotation:</strong>
<ul>The Moon rotates at the same rate it revolves around Earth, resulting in one side always facing us. This is called tidal locking. </ul>
<strong>Lunar Phases:</strong>
<ul>The Moon appears to change shape due to the varying amounts of sunlight on its surface, from a new moon to a full moon. </ul>
<strong>Far Side (not the "Dark Side"):</strong>
<ul>The side of the Moon we don't see from Earth is not perpetually dark but is simply the "far side". </ul>
<h3>Temperature and Atmosphere</h3>
<strong>No Atmosphere:</strong>
<ul>The absence of an atmosphere makes it impossible for life to exist on the Moon and contributes to its extreme temperature fluctuations. </ul>
<strong>Extreme Temperatures:</strong>
<ul>Surface temperatures can range from about 127째C (260째F) during the day to -173째C (-280째F) at night.</ul> 
<strong>Origin </strong>
<ul>Impact Theory: Scientists believe the Moon formed about 4.5 billion years ago when a large object, roughly the size of Mars, collided with Earth, and the resulting debris clumped together to form the Moon.</ul>

    <p>Earth, the third planet from the Sun and our home, is unique for being the only known place in the universe to support life. It's a rocky, water-rich planet with a life-sustaining atmosphere, a magnetic field, and one natural satellite, the Moon. Formed about 4.5 billion years ago, it orbits the Sun and rotates on a tilted axis, which creates day, night, and seasons.  </p>
